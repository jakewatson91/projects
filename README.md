## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Intel Image Classification
This repository contains code for an image classification task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Intel image dataset. The project compares the performance of a custom-built CNN with the popular ResNet architecture.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Intel Image Classification dataset, which contains images of natural scenes such as buildings, forests, mountains, etc. It consists of labeled images belonging to six categories: buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, sea, and streets.
